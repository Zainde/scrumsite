        <h2>history about Scrum</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka introduced the term scrum in the context of product development in their 1986 Harvard Business Review article, "The New New Product Development Game". Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in The Knowledge Creating Company
        that it is a form of "organizational knowledge creation, especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally". The authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and
        flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer industries. They called this the holistic or rugby approach, as the whole process is performed by one cross-functional team across multiple
        overlapping phases, where the team "tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth" In the early 1990s, Ken Schwaber used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods; while Jeff Sutherland, John Scumniotales
        and Jeff McKenna, developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, referring to it using the single word Scrum. In 1995, Sutherland and Schwaber jointly presented a paper describing the Scrum framework at the Business Object Design and Implementation
        Workshop held as part of Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications '95 (OOPSLA '95) in Austin, Texas. Over the following years, Schwaber and Sutherland collaborated to combine this material—with their experience and evolving
        good practice—to develop what became known as Scrum. In 2001, Schwaber worked with Mike Beedle to describe the method in the book, Agile Software Development with Scrum. Scrum's approach to planning and managing product development involves bringing
        decision-making authority to the level of operation properties and certainties. In 2002, Schwaber with others founded the Scrum Alliance and set up the Certified Scrum accreditation series. Schwaber left the Scrum Alliance in late 2009 and founded
        Scrum.org which oversees the parallel Professional Scrum accreditation series. Since 2009, there is a public document called The Scrum Guide that defines a sort of official version of Scrum and is occasionally revised. In 2018 it was expanded
        upon with the publication of The Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams.

        <h2>thoughts behind</h2>
      </header>
      <p>

        Scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for managing product development. It defines "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal", challenges assumptions of the "traditional,
        sequential approach" to product development, and enables teams to self-organize. A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change their minds about what they want or need and that there will be unpredictable challenges,
        for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. As such, Scrum adopts an evidence-based empirical approach, accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's
        ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions. Nonaka, one of the "inventors" of scrum, only loosely relates it to software and instead directly relates
        it to leadership and running the top companies in the world. To both nonaka and takeuchi scrum is how cross-functional teams are working intensely together generating continuous improvements. as read in https://www.scruminc.com/takeuchi-and-nonaka-roots-of-scrum/

      <p>
        during a sprint multiple steps is taken to ensure everything goes smoothly. first thing is the sprint planning. This is where the team discuss and agree on the scope of work to be done during the sprint. this can usually be put into 2 stages. the first
        stage is where the whole scrum team (development team, product owner and scrum master) selects the PBI they believe can be completed in the sprint. second half the development team identifies the detailed work they need to do. this may result
        in some BPI being split or not getting worked on during this sprint. during each day of the sprint there's a daily scrum. it's a small meeting 15 minutes max duration, where the team usually talks about the day before and this day. what they completed
        and are going to work on. also if there's any unforeseen impediments to the goal. during the daily scrum no discussions should take place and is basically so everyone will know what has gotten done and what everyone else is working on. next comes
        2 things generally. the sprint review and the sprint retrospective. the sprint review is where the team show their completed work to the stakeholders and they collaborate together on what to do next. the sprint retrospective is where the team
        reflects on the past sprint and decide what improvements to implement in the next one.
