<h2>history about Scrum</h2>
</header>
<p>
  Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka introduced the term scrum in the context of product development in their
   1986 Harvard Business Review article, "The New New Product Development Game". Takeuchi and Nonaka later
    argued in The Knowledge Creating Company that it is a form of "organizational knowledge creation,
     especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally".

  The authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and
   flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer
    industries. They called this the holistic or rugby approach, as the whole process is performed by one
     cross-functional team across multiple overlapping phases, where the team "tries to go the distance as a
      unit, passing the ball back and forth" (In rugby football, a scrum is used to restart play, as the
       forwards of each team interlock with thei.r heads down and attempt to gain possession of the ball.)

  In the early 1990s, Ken Schwaber used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods;
  while Jeff Sutherland, John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna, developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation,
  referring to it using the single word Scrum.

  In 1995, Sutherland and Schwaber jointly presented a paper describing the Scrum framework at the Business
   Object Design and Implementation Workshop held as part of Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages
    & Applications '95 (OOPSLA '95) in Austin, Texas. Over the following years, Schwaber and Sutherland
     collaborated to combine this material—with their experience and evolving good practice—to develop what
     became known as Scrum.

  In 2001, Schwaber worked with Mike Beedle to describe the method in the book, Agile Software Development
   with Scrum. Scrum's approach to planning and managing product development involves bringing
   decision-making authority to the level of operation properties and certainties.

  In 2002, Schwaber with others founded the Scrum Alliance and set up the Certified Scrum accreditation
   series. Schwaber left the Scrum Alliance in late 2009 and founded Scrum.org which oversees the parallel
    Professional Scrum accreditation series.

  Since 2009, there is a public document called The Scrum Guide that defines a sort of official version
   of Scrum and is occasionally revised. In 2018 it was expanded upon with the publication of The Kanban
    Guide for Scrum Teams.

    <h2>thoughts behind</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for managing product development.
       It defines "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as
       a unit to reach a common goal", challenges assumptions of the "traditional, sequential approach"
        to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location
        or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among
        all team members and disciplines involved.

      A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change their minds about what
      they want or need (often called requirements volatility) and that there will be unpredictable
       challenges—for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. As such, Scrum adopts an
       evidence-based empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined
        up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond
        to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.

      Many of the terms used in Scrum (e.g., scrum master) are typically written with leading capitals
       (e.g., Scrum Master) or as conjoint words written in camel case (e.g., ScrumMaster). To maintain
       an encyclopedic tone, however, this article uses normal sentence case for these terms—unless they
       are recognized marks (such as Certified Scrum Master). This is occasionally seen written in
       all-capitals, as SCRUM. The word is not an acronym, so this is not correct; however, it likely
       arose due to an early paper by Ken Schwaber which capitalized SCRUM in its title.

      While the trademark on the term Scrum itself has been allowed to lapse, so that it is deemed as
      owned by the wider community rather than an individual, the leading capital is retained—except
       when used with other words (as in daily scrum or scrum team).

    <h2>Work tools</h2>

    <p>
      Like other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.

      Many companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the
      sprint backlog. There are also open-source and proprietary software packages for Scrum—which are either
       dedicated to product development using the Scrum framework, or support multiple product development
        approaches including Scrum.

      Other organizations implement Scrum without software tools, and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy
       forms such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes.
